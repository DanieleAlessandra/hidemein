# Frequently Asked Questions
* What this plugin is exactly intended for?
  - I made this piece of script to keep clean WordPress’ dashboard in a project where the site owner really needed me to keep an Administrator account but didn’t want to see me in user’s lists.

* Will I *really* be invisible to *anyone*?
  - You will be invisible to anyone in dashboard, your account will still be visible in database’s tables, and your name could be visible as Author for your own contents. Furthermore plugin’s files will be visible in your filesystem.

* Can i see it in action?
  - This plugins needs Administrator capabilities to work, because of this I’m not able to set up a demo for you at the moment.
