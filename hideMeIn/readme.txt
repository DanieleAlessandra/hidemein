== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What this plugin is exactly intended for =

I made this piece of script to keep clean Wordpress\' dashboard in a project where the site owner really needed me to keep an Administrator account but didn\'t want to see me in user\'s lists.

= Will I really be invisible to anyone? =

You will be invisible to anyone in dashboard, your account will still be visible in database\'s tables, and your name could be visible as Author for your own contents.
